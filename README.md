- [x] 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
- [x] 35. Search Insert Position
- [x] 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower
- [x] 704. Binary Search
### Day 2 (10/4/2025)
- [x] 744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target
### Day 3 (11/4/2025)
- [x] 50. pow(x, n)

## Solution Rationale
- #4 Median of Two Sorted Arrays &rarr; Inserted two vectors into a larger vector and used `stl` sorting algorithm on it.
- (35) Search Insert Position &rarr; Binary search to find if the element is already there **or if it is not, return `lowerBound` since it holds the index at which element should be inserted in**.
- (374) Guess Number Higher or Lower &rarr; Binary search with extra steps.
- (704) Binary Search &rarr; Binary search.
- (744) Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target &rarr; Binary search but with letters.
- (50) pow(x, n) &rarr; Exponentiation by squaring with recursion + wrapper function to handle negative powers.
